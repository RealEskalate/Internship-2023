A2SVs smooth learning process and dedicated team molded me to see the peak of my abilities. Through A2SVs effective education and continual support, I passed Googles internship interviews and attended a summer internship at Google in Amsterdam. However, the A2SV program and training is beyond technical education and interview preparation. As an A2SVian, I also learned the values of putting humanity first, giving back to our community, and utilizing teamwork with my colleagues, which I can now consider my big family. After completing three remarkable months at Google, I was offered a full-time position at Googles London office for 2022. “",
