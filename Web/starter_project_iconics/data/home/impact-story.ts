      "“ When I joined A2SV in 2019, I found the concept of data structures and algorithms quite challenging. A2SV's smooth learning process and dedicated team molded me to see the peak of my abilities. Through A2SV's effective education and continual support, I passed Google's internship interviews and attended a summer internship at Google in Amsterdam. However, the A2SV program and training is beyond technical education and interview preparation. As an A2SVian, I also learned the values of putting humanity first, giving back to our community, and utilizing teamwork with my colleagues, which I can now consider my big family. After completing three remarkable months at Google, I was offered a full-time position at Google's London office for 2022. “",
